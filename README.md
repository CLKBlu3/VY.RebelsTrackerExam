# Back End Exam
> As an imperial programmer your receive the order of implement a new web service that allows to register any rebeld identification.

> The empire has conquered all universe, but it still remains some group of hidden rebelds. Dark forces, soldiers for the empire, distributed over all know galaxies and solar systems forces empire's citizens to be identified. They need you to develop a distributed service that would be able to be called from any location over the universe.

> As interoperability is a must, you decide to use an old fashioned and very extended technology called **wcf webservices/webapi**. The service/api has to expose *a method* that accept a **list of strings** with the name of the rebeld and name of the planet, and response **true** if register goes fine. The register has to be added to a **file** with a **datetime** with the string **_rebeld (name) on (planet) at (datetime)_**.


### Separate responsabilities in separated layers:

> 1. distributed services
> 2. application
> 3. domain
> 4. infrastructure

* Implement **error logging** and manage exceptions in every layer, you can fake it and pretend this is just ocurring.
* Implement **unit test** for any layer, too.
* Take care of **proper naming** convections and **SOLID principles**.
* You can use any **Dependency Injection, Unit Testing, Mocking frameworks** or any other that you consider necessary.
